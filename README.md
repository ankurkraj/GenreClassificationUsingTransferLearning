# Exploring Various Transfer Learning techniques for Genre Classification of Music 

<br> (1) Reading various past literatures and exploring various potential ways to improve the accuracy. </br>
<br> (2) Implemented a transfer learning model(VGG16Net) and trained a classifier, based on following paper(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045790622002506) </br>
<br> (3) Used BiLSTM to classify the outputs of the pretrained VGG16 model, and trained it. </br>
<br> (4) Planning to use datasets like Album cover and lyrics to compare the accuracies for different combinations. </br>
<br> (5) Experimenting with the use of a fine-tuned Large language models as transfer learning model on top of a classifier an publish a paer following this research. </br>

# Exploring techniques leveraging the current advancements in Audio models to improve the accuracy of a Genre classification model.

<br> (1) Using the Whisper-Tiny as a base model and exploring ways like Training a classifier on top of it, finetuning the model etc. To obtain a model with better accuracy.
